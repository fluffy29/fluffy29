- hey guys ! My name is Hassan Majzoub
- I’m interested in computer science and writing
- I’m in university and learning to be a full stack dev

I always thought my dream was to be a writer for a publishing company, sipping my coffee and reading the beginning lines of the next best-selling fiction books.
It seemed like a reasonable dream given by my good grades in English and my creativity. 
I leaned toward writing and my quality in my books. But I kind of just felt like something was off, I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different


And that's what happened, the spark I was missing that kindled the instant I clicked play on my first python tutorial video on youtube.
Since then. I can't get enough of front-end game development and IT calls to all my passions; it unlocked creativity, problem-solving, and even quick thinking. 
With these three I was restless to try to develop my passion more. 


I love applying codes that shape my coding in the game, making the user feel more enjoyed and satisfied with how it runs.
It's oddly satisfying. I think in a way that I'm kind of like these codes in a game; I'm modable, but I keep my creativity flare to its finest.

My specialties include communication, problem-solving, time managing, motivation, learning new skills, and programming languages. 
So far I have learned python throughout the summer and I'm still building my knowledge. 
I'm still enthusiastically grabbing into other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can combine in the coding web in my head.

Thank you for reading my readme :)
